This is a simulation of evolution. The aim was to create a population of critters which could adapt to their changing environment.

# Rules

Food appears randomly and critters eat it in order to be able to metabolise.

Every action requires energy, moving (squared relationship with speed), sensing, breeding.

Each critter has a tendency towards meat eating and plant eating, and separate senses for each.

Breeding results in a mutation in all mutatable properties.
